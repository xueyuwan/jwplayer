我是奥利弗・奎恩
My name is Oliver Queen.

14

五年里  我被困在地狱
After 5 years in hell,

15
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,650
我回来只有一个目标
I returned home with only one goal--

16
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,110
拯救我的城市
to save my city.

17
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,550
现在我有两个身份
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

18
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,990
白天  我是星城的市长
By day, I lead star city as its mayor,

19
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,940
而晚上  我是另一个人
but by night, I am someone else.

20
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,260
我是另一个存在
I am something else.

21
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,680
我就是绿箭侠
I am the Green Arrow.

前警察队长昆汀・兰斯

非常感谢您的信任  市长先生
Appreciate the vote of confidence, mr. Mayor.

26
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,670
你不是星城来的吗
Are you not from Star City?

27
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,100
不是  是海文洛克
No. Havenrock.

28
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,910
有些事你要知道
There's something that I need you to know.

29
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,740
海文洛克并不是原定目标
Havenrock was not the intended target.

30
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,760
有人为了减少伤亡数量改变了
Someone redirected the missile to reduce

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,220
导弹的方向
the number of casualties.

32
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,670
这个人就是我
That someone was me.

33
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,720
从我杀安迪到现在
Ever since I killed Andy...

34
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,780
你觉得你需要被惩罚吗
You think you need to be punished.

35
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,380
别再为我费劲了  莱拉
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.

36
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,630
我们要谈谈约翰
We need to talk about John.

37
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,730
他回国了  在监狱里
He's back in the country, and he's in prison,

38
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,400
我需要你把他弄出来
And I need you to break him out.

39
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,890
快点  奥林匹亚先生  赶紧的

奥林匹亚先生是健美比赛的冠军
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.

41
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,120
我以前  现在是奥林匹克运动员
I was--am an Olympic athlete.

42
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,770
是吗  现在时不时努力了就能拿金牌
Yeah? They give out gold medals for effort now?

43
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,120
真有趣  不过我拿的是铜牌
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.

44
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,510
有那么难记住吗
Why is that so hard to remember?

45
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,390
闭嘴  每次执行任务的时候
Quiet. Every time you're out in the field,

46
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,550
都有可能送命
you could die.

47
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,630
别忘了这一点  集中精神
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.

48
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,760
守望者  找到目标了吗
Overwatch, do we have the target?

49
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,650
正向东出口移动  速度很快
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.

50
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,610
知道他偷了什么吗
Do we know what he stole?

51
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,990
还不知道  不过我有预感
Not yet, but I have a feeling

52
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,470
我们很快就会知道了
we're about to find out.

53
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,330
前提是我们把他拦在警戒线
Only if we snag him in the cordon.

54
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,310
阿耳特弥斯  准备好
Artemis, be ready.

55
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,310
我这次真的可以射人了吗
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?

56
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,890
不是  我不是那个意思
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.

57
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,920
我是说除了...
I just meant that more than--

58
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,120
我们知道你的意思
We know what you meant.

59
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,610
你们要等他到达警戒线
You wait for him to reach the cordon,

60
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,310
然后再动手
then engage.

61
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,830
-明白了吗  -明白
- Do you copy? - Copy.

62
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,570
-明白  -明白
- Copy. - Copy.

63
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,860
可是范围挺大的
Still a lot of ground to cover.

64
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,910
应该让破烂王也来
Rags should be here.

65
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,170
守望者  你知道破烂王的情况吗
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?

66
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,790
我给他发了大概十条短信
I texted him, like, 10 times

67
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,820
然后又发了十条  都没回复
and then 10 more, but nada.

68
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,980
他可能病了
Maybe he's sick.

69
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,430
最近有流感
I mean, the flu's been going around,

70
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,390
而且从他那些破布来看
And by the looks of those rags,

71
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,470
他不怎么经常洗衣服
he does not hit the drycleaner very often.

72
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,210
你好啊  帅哥[西语]
Hola, muchacho.

73
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,890
野狗  让阿耳特弥斯动手
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.

74
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,730
我能搞定
I got him.

75
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,110
搞什么
What the?

76
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,890
交给我
I got him.

What did I say?

让阿耳特弥斯动手
That was Artemis' shot!

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,730
这家伙差点跑掉
Dude was getting away.

81
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,930
不  没有
No, he wasn't.

82
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,340
而你失手了
And you missed.

83
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,420
你以前是海军
You were in the navy.

84
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,940
不应该表现得这么差
You should know better.

85
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,630
其实我是被开除军籍的
I was dishonorably discharged actually.

86
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,470
你以为我不知道吗
You think that I don't know that?

{\an8}科尔德实业

88
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,350

Deliver that and the evidence

89
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,790
交给打击罪案小组  然后回家
to the Anti-Crime Unit and then go home.

你又一次"干得好"
Nice going... again.

93
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,660
我们怎么把这家伙送到打击罪案小组
How are we supposed to get this guy to the ACU,

94
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,030
叫优步吗
call a Uber?

98
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,140
行动都结束  你已经失联好几天了
The op's over, and you've been MIA for days.

99
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,570
这是不可接受的
It's not acceptable.

100
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,440
赶快振作起来
Get it together immediately,

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
否则你就滚蛋
or you're off the team.

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,680
我来就是为了这个
That's why I'm here,

103
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,370
亲口告诉你
to tell you in person.

104
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,340
我退出了
I'm off the team.

105
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,010
这么快就认输了
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.

106
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,950
你不是说才刚开始吗
I thought you were just getting started.

107
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,130
是的  可后来费利西蒂
I was, and then Felicity

108
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,540
跟我说了她对海文洛克所做的事
told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,580
你不知道她告诉我了吗
You didn't know she told me.

110
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,510
她有没有跟你说她当时面对
Did she also tell you that she was faced

111
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,130
两难的选择
with an impossible choice?

112
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,720
我完全明白
I completely realize that.

113
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,400
我知道那不是她的错
I get it wasn't her fault,

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
可是这无法改变
but that doesn't change the fact

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,070
我每次看到她的时候
that every time I look at her

116
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,910
都会想起我的家人
I see the faces of my family,

117
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,400
所有我所爱的人
of everyone I ever loved.

118
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,880
见到费利西蒂我就不断想起
Felicity is a constant reminder

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,160
我所失去的  只要是这种情况
of what I lost, and as long as that's true,

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,030
抱歉
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,300
我不能待在这里
I can't be here.

122
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,500
那你父亲呢
What about your father?

123
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,300
你不是因为他才做这些的吗
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,230
我会找到其他办法去纪念他的
I'll have to find another way to honor him.

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
我很遗憾留不住你
I'm sorry to lose you.

126
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,890
我很遗憾要走
I'm sorry to go.

127
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,410
之前的一切都谢谢你
Thank you for everything.

128
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,180
我是听错了还是
Did my comms deceive me,

129
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,080
你真的让新人去星城警局庆祝胜利了
or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap.

130
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,560
哪来的庆祝胜利
It's never a victory lap.

131
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,560
他们现在能力还不足
They're rough around the edges,

132
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,860
不过除了罗里大家都在进步
But they're making progress except Rory,

133
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,380
他当时在楼上等我
who was waiting for me upstairs

134
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,580
跟我说他要退出
to say that he quit.

135
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,140
他说你告诉他海文洛克的事了
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.

136
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,330
你还好吗
How you holding up?

137
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,960
她不知道吗
She doesn't know?

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,850
约翰入狱的事吗  奥利弗跟我说了
About John being in prison? Oliver told me.

139
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,780
我很为你难过
I'm so sorry.

140
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,770
莱拉的意思是
What Lyla means--

141
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,300
我们要把他救出来
we are gonna break him out.

142
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,930
从军事监狱里救出来
Of military prison?

143
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,450
-没错  -等等  那之后怎么办
- Yep. - Wait, and then what?

144
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,250
约翰后半辈子就要做个逃犯吗
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?

145
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,190
那也总比无辜受罚强
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,070
莱拉  我在研究你给我的安保图纸
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.

147
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
如果约翰配合  就容易很多
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.

148
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,290
{\an8}朗豪军事监狱  安保系统 

149
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,230
{\an8}原始图纸 入口 

150
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,730
{\an8}原始图纸 入口 

151
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,950
现在这是什么情况
You don't have what now?

152
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,430
显然  和回到老婆孩子身边相比
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John

153
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,300
约翰对蹲监狱更感兴趣
than coming home to his own wife and child.

154
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,090
好  等等
Ok. So wait a minute.

155
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,170
现在不仅你们想犯下多项重罪
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies

156
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,310
让约翰后半生都变成逃犯
and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life,

157
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,600
而且他根本就不想跟你们走
he doesn't actually want you to?

158
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,950
我能和你谈谈吗
Can I speak with you for a minute?

159
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,660
好
Yeah.

160
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,780
她这边有问题吗
Is she going to be a problem?

161
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,820
没有  但是
No, but...

162
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,450
我还想让她帮忙呢
I was counting on her being a help.

163
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,360
或许我该找几个我的特工来
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.

164
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,130
不行  如果这事留下你的痕迹
No. If this--if this has your fingerprints on it,

165
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,700
那小约翰的父母就都变成犯人了
then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.

166
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,720
可能有样东西能助我们成功
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.

167
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,510
我刚读了一项新科技的简介
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech,

168
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,790
一种反键分子化合物
An antimolecular compound.

169
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,130
我本想让费利西蒂帮我们搞到手的
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.

170
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,750
莱拉  无论那是什么  我来搞定
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.

171
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,540
二次测试完成
Second test over.

172
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,800
别弄得比拆线还严重就行
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.

173
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,060
安纳托利  如果兄弟会就这样对新成员
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,

174
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,990
我可不愿想象他们怎么对待敌人
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.

175
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,160
通过第三次和最终测试  就明白了
Pass third and final test, find out.

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,230
测试内容是什么
What's the test?

177
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,130
你一直在问科瓦的事
You keep asking about Kovar.

178
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,940
我们的线人说他能让你更接近答案
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.

179
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,390
不过你得快点
You have to act fast, though.

180
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,280
他早上就要被提审了
He will be arraigned in morning.

181
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,380
提审
Arraigned?

182
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,980
-被抓了  -懂了
- Jail. - Yeah

183
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,150
可你怎么知道他会告诉我
But what makes you think he'll talk to me.

184
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,160
信任是相互的
You trust me. I trust you.

185
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,400
现在喝酒还太早了吧  你觉得呢
Look. It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?

186
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,700
这不是让你喝的
It's not for drinking.

187
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,390
安纳托利  你这是干什么
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?

188
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,690
{\an8}{\pos(193.2,220.8)}一边去

189
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,930
{\an8}{\pos(193.2,220.8)}傻逼酒鬼

190
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,070
我是不是应该提前录好迟到的道歉
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.

191
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,670
没事  西娅告诉我们了
Don't worry. Thea told us.

192
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,870
我很遗憾  哥们  痛风太难缠了
I'm sorry, man. Gout is a bitch.

193
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,060
可不是吗
Yes, it is.

194
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,810
其实我想休假好好治疗一下
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.

195
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,510
好在现在有了副市长
Well, fortunately, we now have

196
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,270
可以帮忙挑这个重担
a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.

197
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,600
和你共事一定很愉快
It'll be great working with you.

198
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,530
你的职业生涯很令人钦佩  兰斯先生
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?

199
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,020
是把  现在外面很多人
Yeah. I mean, a lot of people out there

200
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,840
可能没这么想
probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion.

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,580
不过谢谢你
But thank you.

202
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,290
当人民公仆不容易啊
Public service isn't easy.

203
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,640
有时清除污秽也会脏及自身
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.

204
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,760
说起这个  我听说昨晚逮捕了一个人
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night

205
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,000
或许能在托拜厄斯・丘奇案上帮到我们
that may help in our case against Tobias Church.

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,820
是塞吉奥・埃斯皮诺萨  洛斯・阿尔的孔长期同伙
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member

207
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,460
后来成了丘奇的左膀右臂
Turned Church strongman.

208
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,900
绿箭侠和他调皮的治安维护者
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes

209
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,990
把他当礼物送给了打击罪案小组
left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.

210
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,860
就差个蝴蝶结了
The only thing that was missing was a bow.

211
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,840
你听起来好像不太开心
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.

212
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,010
治安维持者只能暂时解决问题
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.

213
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,830
如果还得靠他们来帮我们维持治安
If we need their help to get our streets clean--

214
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,460
就代表了我们的工作还不到位
It means we haven't done our jobs right.

215
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,220
你觉得你能让埃斯皮诺萨供出丘奇吗
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?

216
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,270
我会给他施压  看他会不会妥协
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.

217
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,210
你要确保不会有什么腐败警察包庇他
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.

218
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,050
不可能的
Not a chance.

219
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,280
我会亲自查看保管链上的每一个证据
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.

220
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,920
很好  假如你没意见的话
Good. Uh, if it's all right with you,

221
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,990
我会让昆汀协助你
I'll have Quentin accompany you,

222
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,670
我不在的时候就让他做我的眼睛和耳朵
be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.

223
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,420
当然没意见
Sure.

224
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,680
给我们点时间让我们熟悉彼此
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.

225
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,780
好极了
Great.

226
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,040
抱歉  但从什么时候起我的职责里
I'm sorry. When did, uh, babysitting evidence

227
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,500
还包括了保护证据
become part of the job description?

228
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,840
我信任你
Since I trust you.

229
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,510
真的吗
You do?

230
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,800
在发生了所有一切之后
I mean, all things considered?

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
如果我们不觉得你是这份工作的好人选
If we didn't think you were right for the job,

232
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,510
我们怎么会对你发出邀请呢  是吧
we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?

233
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,680
我这一周都滴酒未沾
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?

234
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,580
说起来你到底要去哪里
Where the hell are you going anyway?

235
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,950
这时候度假有点奇怪吧
Strange time for a vacation.

236
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,350
并不是去度假
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.

237
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,620
我该问吗
Should I even ask?

238
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,530
不该  我不会离开很久的
No. I--I'm not gonna be gone long.

239
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,360
拜托你们确保一下
Just please make sure

240
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,150
我不在的期间没人毁了这座城市就好
that no one destroys the city while I'm away.

241
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,950
没问题
Sure.

242
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,350
好吧
OK.

243
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,360
你在干什么
What are you doing?

244
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,220
重新查看星城警局的证物记录
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log

245
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,380
查看我们昨晚
on what we kept from getting stolen

246
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,250
帮科尔德实业保住的东西
from Kord Industries last night.

247
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,880
-6800处理器  -然后呢
- 6,800 processor. - So?

248
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,970
没错  科尔德从事尖端科技
Exactly. Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech,

249
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,080
军用级别的武器
military-grade weapons,

250
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,980
里面有这么多足以毁灭城市的东西
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.

251
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,060
为什么丘奇却让人去偷一个
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip

252
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,210
科技商店就能买到的电脑芯片
That you could buy from any tech village store?

253
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,240
管他呢  所有东西都要被锁起来了
Well, who cares? Everything's on its way to lockup now.

254
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,390
因为丘奇的最后一步
Because knowing what Church's endgame was

255
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,840
让我觉得这事儿并没有结束  还在蛰伏
is like--it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.

256
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,880
你还好吧
You all right over there?

257
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,550
因为我一直说个不停  你却一言不发
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't,

258
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,030
很奇怪啊
which is very weird.

259
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,680
你还记得你让我告诉罗里海文洛克的真相吗
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?

260
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,510
是啊
Yeah.

261
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,750
他并不是得流感请假了是吧
Oh! He's not sick with the flu, is he?

262
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,680
嗯  他只是受不了和我共事
No. He's just sick of working with me.

263
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,990
你有试着和他谈谈吗
Did you try talking to him?

264
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,170
他全家人都死了
There's not a lot I can say

265
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,400
我说什么都没办法让他好过一点吧
that would make him feel OK about his entire family being killed.

266
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,150
有消息
Incoming.

267
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,510
又一起抢劫发生在...
Another robbery in progress at--

268
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,570
帕尔默科技  我得打电话给奥利弗
Palmer Tech! I got to call Oliver.

269
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,950
{\an8}{\pos(128,66.133)}警报 发生劫案

270
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,950
{\an8}{\pos(132.8,138.133)}帕尔默科技

271
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,840
或许不该打  就让他们被抢
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let them get robbed.

272
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,650
报丹尼斯先生解雇我们之仇
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.

273
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,320
他只炒了我  你是自己辞职的
He fired me. You quit.

274
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
因为他炒了你  没差啦
Because he fired you. Same thing.

275
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,200
桑切斯  你那有发现吗
Sanchez, you got anything?

276
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,020
没有
Nada.

277
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,370
怎么了
What's up?

278
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,810
有人闯进帕尔默科技了
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.

279
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,790
你还在那片吗
Are you still in the area?

280
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,440
在  我可以去看看
Yeah. I can look into that.

281
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,910
帕尔默科技怎么样了
How was Palmer Tech?

282
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,680
在你回答之前
Before you answer,

283
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,990
你要意识到你的手机是有定位的
you should consider that your phone has GPS,

284
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,610
假如你还想撒谎的话
and if you were thinking about lying,

285
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,650
那我佩服你前后说法的一致性
I do admire your consistency.

286
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,330
我没想着骗你
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.

287
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,660
我只是不想把你牵扯进来
I wasn't looping you in

288
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,560
毕竟你明确表示过你不赞成这个决定
after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.

289
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,020
是约翰自己不赞成这个计划
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.

290
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,450
约翰现在不理智
John's not thinking clearly.

291
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,400
我赌罗伊是理智的  假如他在这里的话
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,

292
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,220
我觉得他会告诉你
I think he would tell you

293
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,380
逃亡的生活根本不算生活
that life on the run is no life at all,

294
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,860
而且我似乎记得你是不赞成那个计划的
and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.

295
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,370
罗伊当时在做一个错误的选择
Roy was making a bad choice

296
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,500
和约翰现在一样
just like John is making a bad choice.

297
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,260
他如今因为一个他没犯过的罪
He is currently locked up in a military prison

298
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,070
而被关在军事监狱里
for a crime he didn't commit.

299
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,940
那是为他之前犯的罪赎过  这有什么错呢
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?

300
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,840
约翰自己不想走
John doesn't want to leave.

301
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
这不应该由你来决定
It is not your choice.

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,830
为什么你老是去替他做出选择
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?

303
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,810
他已经抛弃这个团队了
He already abandoned the team.

304
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,970
我不能让他再抛弃他的家庭
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.

305
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,230
是因为这个吗
Is that what this is about,

306
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,360
因为约翰离开了团队
John leaving the team?

307
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,410
这事很简单
This is simple.

308
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,280
我要阻止约翰做出他一定会后悔的决定
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.

309
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,520
你应该考虑一下对罗里做同样的事情
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.

310
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,000
你意识到我和罗里谈谈话的性质
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory

311
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,130
完全不同于你去犯几个重罪吧
is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?

312
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,290
你有想到你会再次干这种事吗
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again,

313
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,690
处理证据
handling evidence?

314
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,790
没有  我也没想到我会成为副市长
No. Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either,

315
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,750
然后就成了如今这样
But here we are.

316
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,640
老实说  我很惊讶你居然接受了
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.

317
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,710
我听说  你和奎恩有着...
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh--

318
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,870
复杂的过往
a complicated history.

319
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,320
一定得放下很多前嫌吧
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.

320
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,810
是啊  起码我知道我是如何放下的
Yeah. Well, at least I know where they're buried.

321
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,930
那是买不来也偷不走的东西
That's something you can't buy or steal.

322
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,740
东西到了  老大
Package is here, boss.

323
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,760

准备好行动
Get ready to move.

326
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,530
我猜猜  费利西蒂跟你们说的
Let me guess. Felicity filled you in.

327
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,820
说你打算闯进军事监狱吗
That you're gonna break into a military prison?

328
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,240
对  而你还好意思叫我野狗
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?

329
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,210
不想再争论这事
I'm done debating this.

330
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,760
真的吗  因为我们还是头一次听说
Really? Because this is the first we've heard of it.

331
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,150
还以为我们是团队
I thought we were your team.

332
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,630
一个人跑去劫狱
Running off to bust someone out of prison

333
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,090
是队友干的事吗
sounds like team business,

334
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,320
你被抓了  我们会怎样
And what happens to us when you get caught?

335
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,440
你说得很清楚了
You've made it clear that

336
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,310
有你在  我们才能当治安维护者
we can't do this vigilante thing without you.

337
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,550
等我被抓了  我不会被抓的
When I get caught? I'm not gonna get caught.

338
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,230
对  因为我们不会放你那么做
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.

339
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,250
抱歉
I'm sorry.

340
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,280
你是说你们不会放我走吗
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?

341
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,290
对  我得看着你亲自把证物存好了
Yes. I need to see you physically deposit the item.

342
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,770
我干这活有十五年了
I've been on this job 15 years.

343
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,080
从没弄丢一份证据
I've never lost a piece of evidence.

344
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,380
别有压力  警官
Now relax, sergeant.

345
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,580
我们不是怀疑你的专业能力
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?

346
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,130
像是怀疑
Seems like.

347
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,890
好了
This is it.

348
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,470
我可以开始干活了吗
You gonna let me do my job now?

349
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,470

抱歉  先生们
Sorry, gents.

355

装上武器
Load them up!

356
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,790
然后把这里炸掉
And burn this puppy down.

357
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,960
走  快走
Let's go, let's go!

358
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,610
好了
OK.

359
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,690
最后机会
Last chance.

360
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,260
别挡道
Get off the street.

361
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,420
没想到他真的对你们动手了
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.

362
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,130
你知道最操蛋的是什么吗
You know what really sucks?

363
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,760
发现之前所有的训练中
Realizing that in all those training sessions

364
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,150
他虽然把我们揍了个遍
where he was kicking our respective asses

365
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,400
但他还是有所保留
the whole time he was taking it easy on us.

366
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,130
对  也提醒我
Yeah. Remind me to never, ever

367
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,520
绝对不要惹毛他
get on his bad side.

368
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,780
我想也就是说他有温柔的一面
I think that would imply that he has a good side,

369
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,920
费利西蒂  麻烦你再解释一下
And, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again

你怎么觉得这样能行得通
how you thought this was all gonna go down?

371
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,690
我原以为如果看到你们团结一致
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united

372
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,360
反对他的疯狂计划  他就会三思
against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.

373
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,580
对哦  因为都知道奥利弗・奎恩
Right because Oliver Queen is known

374
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,140
会三思后行  听取别人的意见呢
for thinking things through and taking input from others.

375
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,940
好
Right.

376
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,180
这里越来越人丁兴旺了

我是西娅  奥利弗的幕僚长

379
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,090
也是他的妹妹

380
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,820
被跟我说奥利弗也揍你
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too,

381
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,150
奥利干的
Ollie did this?

382
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,250
实战教学  说来话长

What happened to you?

385
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,460
托拜厄斯・丘奇干的
Tobias Church happened.

386
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,960
你们从科尔德实业那找到的证据
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries--

387
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,700
被改成了炸弹
Modified to go boom.

388
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,760
是他要把东西收藏起来的
He wanted it to be put into lockup.

389
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,840
他还想抢劫
And he wanted to raid it.

390
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,380
一次性解决武器问题
One-stop shopping for weapons.

391
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,960
还包括从艾美科技那偷走的火箭筒
Including those RPGs that he took from AmerTek

392
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,910
如果报告无误的话
If this report's right.

393
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,880
{\an8}事故报告

394

{\an8}事故总结

395
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,150
我们得弄清他打算
We got to find out what he's planning

396
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,420
用这些武器干什么  肯定图谋不轨
to do with those weapons--because it ain't nothing good.

397
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,090
奥利弗真不该这个时候出城
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.

398
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,730
我试过联系他了  没音讯
Yeah. I just tried him. He's gone dark.

399
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,510
你们不如出去打听一下
Why don't you guys hit the streets?

400
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,070
趁还来得及  得赶紧弄清
We want to figure out what Church is up to

401
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,210
丘奇有什么打算
before it's too late.

402
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,350
你确定
You sure?

403
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,220
我想奥利弗不愿让我们单独执行任务
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.

404
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,040
对  奥利弗不在  他就无权干涉
Right. Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.

405
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,580
好  所以现在得全员出动
OK, but this is an all hands on deck situation,

406
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,140
伤员也得出动
rag-covered hands included.

407
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,610
我就说说
Just saying.

413
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,550
名单上没有你
I don't see you on the list.

414
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,380
你的指挥官应该提交人员变动表
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.

415
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,590
你确定他没提交吗
You sure he didn't?

416
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,050
回基地得开一个小时的车
It's an hour's drive back to the base.

417

你怎么知道这个名字
How do you know that name?

正如我知道你叫彼得・弗里德金

445
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,270

轮到你去巡查
Your turn to run system check.

457
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,930
我去上厕所
I'm gonna hit the head.

458
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,720
别碰我的球
Don't touch my ball.

459
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,200
兄弟  搞什么呢
Dude, what the hell?

我给你指出约翰牢房的路线
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.

463
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,600
我来的不是时候吗
Hey. Is this... uh, is this a bad time?

464
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,430
我压根不想知道你是怎么找到我的
Do I want to even ask how you found me?

465
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,700
我觉得这问题很难回答
Heh. I feel like that's a trick question.

466
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,130
抱歉这里很乱
Sorry about the mess.

467
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,440
这个真了不起
These are amazing.

468
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,920
花时间修补别人丢弃之物
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs,

469
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,180
发觉其有用的地方
you find ways to make something useful out of them.

470
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,960
我父亲以前总是这么说
My father always used to say that.

471
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,530
他以前有间当铺
He owned a pawn shop.

00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,120
在南摩尔路吧
On Southmoor Road, right?

473
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,480
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

474
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,240
上周  你和奥利弗说你加入绿箭团队
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team

475
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
是为了纪念你父亲
to honor your father.

476
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
当你退出时
When you quit...

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,270
我想找出更多你放弃的原因
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.

481
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,610
但他不是因此而成为英雄的  对吧
but that's not what made him a hero, was it?

482
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,180
不是
No.

483
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,280
他穿着你修补的旧货
He wore your rags,

484
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,660
就像他的祖父一样  也叫罗里
like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.

485
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,440
这是个需要背负的巨大传承
That's a big legacy to live up to.

486
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,560
而我要背负的是发生在海文洛克的不幸
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.

487
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,470
我余下人生中的每一天
I'm gonna have to live with that

488
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,180
都得背负这件事
every day for the rest of my life,

明知无法补救
Knowing that I cannot fix it

明知那不会是我犯下的
and knowing that it's not the last mistake

491
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,280
最后一个错误
that I'm ever going to have to make.

492
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,450
我还是不知道我是否能
I still don't know if I can--

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,750
和一个提醒着你自己失去了什么的人
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder

我知道两件事不一样
and I-I know they're not the same thing.

498
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,190
但是我们的目的一样
We both want the same thing,

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,690
能够接受所发生的事
to be able to live with what's happened

500
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,740
我们才能继续活下去

就是把约翰和所有的囚犯

521
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,740
转移到更安全的地方  我们就没机会了

不是什么都不做
Not nothing.

607
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,990
你害怕了
You scared?

608
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,070
没有  但是我不蠢
No, but I'm not stupid either.

609
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,190
艾薇说得对
Evie's right.

610
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,470
我不能让你们去送死
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.

611
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,490
感谢你的信任
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

612
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,250
你看到了你要面对的情况
You saw what you're up against, ok?

613
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,940
这和训练中不一样
This isn't some drill where you take down

614
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,420
不是对付小歹徒或毒贩
a petty thug or drug dealer.

615
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,360
这是实战  真正的危险
This is real, ok, with real stakes.

616
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,880
你们三个也许会牺牲
The three of you could die out there.

617
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,960
这要我们自己决定
That's something we get to decide for ourselves,

618
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,520
不是吗
isn't it?

619
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,520
我不知道其他人怎么想的
I mean, I don't know about everyone else,

620
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,810
但我不是为了保命才加入这个团队
but I didn't join this team to stay safe.

621
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,510
好吧  我们投个票吧
Ok. Why don't we take a vote?

622
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,310
同意的人...
All those in favor...

623
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,020
我们都投赞成票  金发妞
We're all gonna say yes, blondie.

624
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,640
天  那不是我的名字
God. That's not my name.

625
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,690
好吧  去吧  注意安全
Good. Ok. Go. Do not die.

626
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,960
黄色警报
Code yellow.

627
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,910
将所有犯人押回牢房
Return all prisoners to their cells.

628
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,890
黄色警报
Code yellow.

629
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,760
将所有犯人押回牢房
Return all prisoners to their cells.

630
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,000
约翰  还好吗
Hey, John. What's new?

631
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,640
我不越狱  我告诉过莱拉
I'm not doing this. I told Lyla.

632
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,890
你可以之后再向我们发火
Yeah. You can yell at us later,

633
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,360
但现在我们赶时间
but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.

634
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,650
你有听我说的话吗
Are you even hearing me right now?

635
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,030
我一点都不想越狱
I don't want anything to do with this.

636
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,400
宪兵们几分钟后做清点
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.

637
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,450
我想他们只希望看到这里一个人
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.

638
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,720
真的吗  你就这样威胁我
Really? So that's your play, blackmail?

639
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,760
要么按你说的做  要么害你也被抓
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?

640
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,030
你是我兄弟  约翰
You're my brother, John.

641
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,670
你我同甘共苦
What happens to you happens to me.

642
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,850
奥利弗...
Oliver...

643
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,900
我杀了自己弟弟
I killed my brother.

644
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,300
我参军以求改变
I went to the army to change,

645
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,700
却没能改变
and I haven't changed.

646
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,190
我知道  好吗
I know, all right,

647
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,750
我也知道你觉得现在是赎罪
and I know that you think this is your penance for that.

648
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,780
奥利弗  还不止这样
Oliver, it's not just that.

649
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,070
我信任安迪
I trusted Andy.

650
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,880
即便你叫我提防他  我还是信任他
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him,

651
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,080
但劳蕾尔死了
and now Laurel's dead.

652
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,430
我需要你  团队需要你  这座城需要你
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.

653
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,310
我不是说你不该赎罪
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.

654
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,690
你或许是该赎罪
You probably should,

655
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,720
但要像个勇士一样去赎罪
but do it as Spartan.

656
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,090
盒子里是什么
What's in the box?

657
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,210
是反分子化合物
It's an antimolecular compound,

658
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,300
从理论上说  它应该能噬穿任何物体
and theoretically, it should eat through anything.

659
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,330
我也不打算问你从哪弄来的
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.

660
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,770
你回来找我了
Hey. You came back for me,

661
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,070
虽然我叫你别来
even against my wishes.

662
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,240
我猜我也没怎么变
I guess I haven't changed that much either.

663
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,010
或许我该为这个赎罪
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.

664
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,480
你刚才用的东西以后绝对能派上大用场
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.

665
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,060
前提是莱拉一直盯着超能力联合调查组
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for ARGUS.

666
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,590
早该料到有她的份
Should have known she'd be helping out.

667
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,190
告诉约翰以后再谢我
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.

668
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,360
你们继续走
You've got to keep moving.

669
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,750
沿地下层向北走200米然后爬上去
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.

670
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,670
那...那是什么声音
What--what is it?

671
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,670
通讯中断了
Comm's being jammed.

672
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,880
不不不
No, no, no.

673
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,410
还有别的出口吗
Hey. Is there another way out of here?

674
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,860
介意在你死前  解开我的手铐吗
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?

675
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,660
如果你要炸掉那面墙
Hey. If that's for taking out the wall,

676
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,190
我们还没出去就会被炸死
the blast will kill us before we can get out.

677
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,240
我们离得太近了
We're in too tight.

678
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,210
-相信我  -是啊  相信一个面目狰狞的...
- Trust me. ?- Yeah, says the creepy-looking--?

679
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,130
你到底是什么鬼东西
What the hell are you anyways?

680
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,670
就位  炸吧
I'm in place. Blow it.

681
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,660
抱歉炸了你们的大楼
Sorry we blew up your building.

682
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,820
快点
Come on!

683
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,070
我们上去
We're going up.

684
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,340
然后呢
Then what?

685
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,140
走哪边  守望者
Which way, overwatch?

686
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,400
在走廊尽头右转
Take a right ?at the end of that hallway.?

687
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,490
应该是个消防出口
It should be a fire exit.

688
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,970
你们出去以后就能轻松回家了
If you go through there, you're home free easy.

689
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,050
没那么轻松
Not so easy.

690
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,310
破烂王  掩护我
Rags, cover me.

691
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,820
走走走
Go! Go, go!

692
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,710
走
Go!

693
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,760
走
Go!

694
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,600
扶他起来
Get him up.

695
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,260
起来
Come on.

696
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,880
我或许应该直接打死你们
I probably should just shoot you,

697
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,030
但是...
But...

698
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,210
你们得尝点苦头
But you've earned a little suffering.

699
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,390
带他去安全的地方
Get him to safety.

700
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,910
-但是...  -快走
- But-- - Go!

701
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,930
留活口
Hey. Don't kill him.

702
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,660
他或许有点用
He may have his uses.

703
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,470
我们得回去救野狗
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.

704
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,840
收到  守望者  卓越先生受伤了
Copy. Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.

705
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,910
我们需要帮助
We could use some help.

706
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,470
车进站了  坚持住
Inbound. Hold on.

707
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,340
上车
Get in!

708
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,000
野狗那孩子呢
Where's the Wild Dog kid?

709
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,620
还在里面  跟丘奇打斗
Still inside, fighting Church.

710
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,920
我们得回去救他
We've got to go back for him.

711
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,910
不行  除非你们都想死
No. Unless you all want to die,

712
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,190
我们现在就得离开  就现在
We've got to go now, now!

713
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,470
我们不能就这样丢下他
We can't just leave him.

714
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,210
你们没得选  快走
You have to. Go.

715
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,420
上车
Come on!

716
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,910
-给  -这是什么
- Here. - What's this?

717
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,160
穿上
Just put it on.

718
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,930
我们走
Let's go.

719
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,140
狄格  你的护具
Dig, your harness.

720
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,390
你们两个  不许动
You two, freeze!

721
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,280
趴在地上  双手放在脑后
Down on the ground! Lace your fingers behind your head!

722
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,120
现在就照做  否则我们开枪了
Do it now, or we will shoot!

723
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,240
约翰  别动
John, don't move.

724
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,120
你暂时待在这里避风头
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being,

725
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,850
我们会找到一个长久的办法
until we find a permanent solution.

726
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,320
先做紧急的事
Hey. First things first.

727
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,680
不敢相信你帮我越狱
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.

728
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,430
你出来了就好  约翰
For better or worse, Johnny.

729
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,000
我想留在监狱的
Told you I wanted to stay.

730
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,260
我想着  如果你想要自己做决定
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions

731
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,640
你就不会结婚了
then you wouldn’t have gotten married.

732
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,540
你们决定救我时  费利西蒂有多生气
Ok. How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?

733
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,460
你怎么知道她觉得这是馊主意
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?

734
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,950
我了解费利西蒂
I know Felicity.

735
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
怎么了
What's wrong?

736
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
我得走了
I have to go.

737
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
你说你没改变...
When you said you haven't changed...

738
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,810
那就别改变
Don't.

739
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,200
早上好
Dobroye utro.

740
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,650
在俄罗斯监狱的第一晚过得如何
How was first night in Russian prison?

741
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,800
弗里德金供出了情报点  现在他死了
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.

742
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,210
任务完成
Mission accomplished.

743
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,070
你在讽刺  是吧
You're being sarcasm, yes?

744
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,080
那人不构成威胁  阿纳托利
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.

745
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,830
他不该死
He didn't deserve to die.

746
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,570
在兄弟会  为了达成目的一定会死人
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.

747
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,030
如果弗里德金活着  他会去警告科瓦
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.

748
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,500
如果他去警告科瓦
If he is warning Kovar,

749
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,490
他的情报就不会准确
his information not so good.

750
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,720
明白吗
Vy ponimayete?

751
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,290
你本可以向我解释清楚
Maybe you could have explained that to me

752
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,020
再派我过去
before you sent me in there.

753
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,430
我差点手软了
I almost didn't kill him.

754
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,820
但你还是杀了  为什么
But you did. Why?

755
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,590
因为你叫我这么做
Because you told me to.

756
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,980
你信任我们
You trust us.

757
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,030
我们也信任你
Now we trust you.

758
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,870
第三次测试结束
Third test over.

759
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,460
明白吗
You get it?

760
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,670
你现在是兄弟会的人了
You are Bratva now, family.

761
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
这个城市里仅剩的警界骨干
Last handful of honest cops in this city,

762
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,050
丘奇差点把我和他们一起干掉
and Church nearly took them out along with me.

763
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,690
幸好你没出事
We're just glad you're all right.

764
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,690
我认为这是一场公关危机
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare.

765
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,470
发生这一系列事情  市长也失踪了
Something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.

766
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,590
听着  他今早打了电话
Look. He called in this morning.

767
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,360
他身体差不多恢复了
His health problems are almost over.

768
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,910
真是个好消息
That's good news.

769
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,070
我们  我们听说
Um, we're--we're hearing that

770
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,190
有一名参与救援的治安维持者
one of the, uh, Vigilantes who was part of the rescue,

771
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,060
没能逃出来
that he didn't make it out.

772
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,510
有他的消息吗
Um, any word on him?

773
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,940
犯罪现场小组没找到尸体
CSU hasn't found a body, so...

774
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,680
那么他在丘奇手上
So Church has him.

775
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,720
我之前一直认为
I spent most of my life thinking that

776
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,670
戴面具的人不可能是好人
men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.

777
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,030
我的想法得改改了
I may have to reevaluate that.

778
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,800
奎恩来了记得告诉我
Let me know when Queen gets in.

779
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
好的
Will do.

780
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,240
你还好吗
Are you all right?

781
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,610
是的  很好
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

782
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,350
我不是很了解那孩子  西娅
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.

783
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,040
但并不代表你就不那么心疼
But that doesn't make it sting any less.

784
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,520
当然  当然是这样
Well, yeah, sure it does.

785
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,700
我那些年很糟糕  现在这不算什么
The year I've had, this is--this is easy.

786
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,270
没错  听起来确实很冷血
Yeah. I mean, cold as that sounds.

787
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,790
听着  我知道你为什么会问
Look. I know why you're asking, ok,

788
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,130
我  我很好
and I'm--I'm fine.

789
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,520
行
Ok.

790
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,700
我意思是  我就是想说
I mean, I'm--I'm--I'm just saying

791
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,770
如果情况不那么顺
if things ever get less easy,

792
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,370
我一直都会陪着你  知道吗
you know I'm here for you, right?

793
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,490
知道了
Noted...

794
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,990
我很感激
and appreciated.

795
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,680
好吧
Ok.

796
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,020
如果你用侦察卫星图像找不到任何人
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery

797
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,690
那你用那个还有什么意义
if you can't use it to find anybody?

798
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,920
我觉得我不是很理解
I feel like I don't understand

799
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,780
你说的是什么意思
half the sentences you say.

800
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,990
我是说  无论我怎么找
What I'm saying is that no matter how hard I try

801
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,110
我都找不到雷内
I cannot find Rene anywhere.

802
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,810
而且是我要你们把他丢下的
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.

803
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,830
听着感觉是很困难的决定
Sounds like another impossible decision.

804
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,730
你是说我应该学学怎么做决定吗
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?

805
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,370
我是说你的决定是对的
I'm saying you were right.

806
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,060
如果我们要维护治安
If we're gonna do this,

807
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,160
就不能让罪恶感吞噬我们
we can't let guilt swallow us up.

808
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,530
我会帮你摆脱罪恶感
I'll keep you from doing it

809
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,230
只要你也这样向我承诺
if you promise the same for me.

810
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,920
行
Deal.

811
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,360
叫什么呢
So "ow" then?

812
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,320
没有奥利弗在
Things have really fallen apart

813
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,220
事情都变糟了  不是吗
without Oliver, haven't they?

814
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,840
好消息是我回来了
It's a good thing I'm back then.

815
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,270
他一直在等着我们说到他才来吧
Was he waiting for an entrance line?

816
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,420
不  他就是这么酷
Nope. He's just that cool.

817
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,680
我收到你的信息了  找到雷内了吗
I got your text. Have we found Rene?

818
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,680
约翰出来了吗
You get John?

819
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,320
是的  他很好  已经藏在蜂巢了
Yeah. He's fine. He's holed up at HIVE.

820
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,410
我不能丢下他
I couldn't write him off,

821
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,270
我们同样不能丢下雷内
and we are not gonna write off Rene.

822
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,380
我们会找到他
We're gonna find him,

823
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,820
我们要把他带回来
We're gonna bring him back...

824
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,920
无论他在哪
wherever he is.

825
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,280
醒来啦
Ah. Wakey, wakey.

826
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,080
哥们  我已经很久
Man, it's been a long time

827
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,060
没被这样绑过了
since I've been tagged like this.

828
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,440
谢谢了
Respect.

829
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,750
这是我的荣幸
Oh, my pleasure,

830
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,380
我向你保证  如果你给我松绑
but I promise you if you untie me

831
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,600
我会加倍"感谢"你的
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.

832
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,780
哥们  你真有种
Ooh, man, you got spirit.

833
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,280
真让人印象深刻
And I'm duly impressed.

834
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,600
我会消磨你的勇气
And I'm gonna break this spirit.

835
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,340
我会折磨你的灵魂
I'm going to break your soul.

836
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,040
完事以后
And when we're finished,

837
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,550
假设你还活着
assuming you're still alive.

838
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,400
不过现在  我可不会保证
Now, I wouldn't bet no money on that, though.

839
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,180
回去跟绿箭侠一起共事的你
This gonna be very little of you left for

840
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,310
不会再完整了
the Green Arrow to work with.

841
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,800
接着电
Light him up.
