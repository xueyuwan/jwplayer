13
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,010
My name is Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,360
After 5 years in hell,

15
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,650
I returned home with only one goal--

16
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,110
to save my city.

17
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,550
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

18
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,990
By day, I lead star city as its mayor,

19
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,940
but by night, I am someone else.

20
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,260
I am something else.

21
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,680
I am the Green Arrow.

22
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,560
Previously on "Arrow"...

23
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,200
Former police captain Quentin Lance,

24
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,470
who will be serving beside meas.

25
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,960
Appreciate the vote of confidence, mr. Mayor.

26
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,670
Are you not from Star City?

27
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,100
No. Havenrock.

28
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,910
There's something that I need you to know.

29
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,740
Havenrock was not the intended target.

30
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,760
Someone redirected the missile to reduce

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,220
the number of casualties.

32
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,670
That someone was me.

33
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,720
Ever since I killed Andy...

34
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,780
You think you need to be punished.

35
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,380
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.

36
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,630
We need to talk about John.

37
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,730
He's back in the country, and he's in prison,

38
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,400
And I need you to break him out.

39
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,890
Come on, Mr. Olympia. Hustle up.

40
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,830
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.

41
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,120
I was--am an Olympic athlete.

42
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,770
Yeah? They give out gold medals for effort now?

43
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,120
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.

44
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,510
Why is that so hard to remember?

45
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,390
Quiet. Every time you're out in the field,

46
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,550
you could die.

47
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,630
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.

48
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,760
Overwatch, do we have the target?

49
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,650
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.

50
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,610
Do we know what he stole?

51
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,990
Not yet, but I have a feeling

52
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,470
we're about to find out.

53
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,330
Only if we snag him in the cordon.

54
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,310
Artemis, be ready.

55
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,310
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?

56
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,890
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.

57
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,920
I just meant that more than--

58
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,120
We know what you meant.

59
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,610
You wait for him to reach the cordon,

60
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,310
then engage.

61
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,830
- Do you copy? - Copy.

62
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,570
- Copy. - Copy.

63
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,860
Still a lot of ground to cover.

64
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,910
Rags should be here.

65
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,170
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?

66
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,790
I texted him, like, 10 times

67
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,820
and then 10 more, but nada.

68
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,980
Maybe he's sick.

69
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,430
I mean, the flu's been going around,

70
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,390
And by the looks of those rags,

71
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,470
he does not hit the drycleaner very often.

72
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,210
Hola, muchacho.

73
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,890
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.

74
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,730
I got him.

75
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,110
What the?

76
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,890
I got him.

78
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,240
What did I say?

79
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,480
That was Artemis' shot!

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,730
Dude was getting away.

81
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,930
No, he wasn't.

82
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,340
And you missed.

83
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,420
You were in the navy.

84
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,940
You should know better.

85
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,630
I was dishonorably discharged actually.

86
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,470
You think that I don't know that?

88
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,350
Deliver that and the evidence

89
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,790
to the Anti-Crime Unit and then go home.

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,230
What about tonight's training session?

91
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,040
You're taking a few days off.

92
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,790
Nice going... again.

93
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,660
How are we supposed to get this guy to the ACU,

94
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,030
call a Uber?

97
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,330
Oliver.

98
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,140
The op's over, and you've been MIA for days.

99
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,570
It's not acceptable.

100
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,440
Get it together immediately,

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
or you're off the team.

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,680
That's why I'm here,

103
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,370
to tell you in person.

104
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,340
I'm off the team.

105
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,010
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.

106
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,950
I thought you were just getting started.

107
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,130
I was, and then Felicity

108
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,540
told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,580
You didn't know she told me.

110
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,510
Did she also tell you that she was faced

111
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,130
with an impossible choice?

112
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,720
I completely realize that.

113
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,400
I get it wasn't her fault,

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
but that doesn't change the fact

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,070
that every time I look at her

116
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,910
I see the faces of my family,

117
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,400
of everyone I ever loved.

118
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,880
Felicity is a constant reminder

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,160
of what I lost, and as long as that's true,

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,030
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,300
I can't be here.

122
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,500
What about your father?

123
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,300
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,230
I'll have to find another way to honor him.

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm sorry to lose you.

126
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,890
I'm sorry to go.

127
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,410
Thank you for everything.

128
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,180
Did my comms deceive me,

129
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,080
or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap.

130
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,560
It's never a victory lap.

131
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,560
They're rough around the edges,

132
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,860
But they're making progress except Rory,

133
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,380
who was waiting for me upstairs

134
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,580
to say that he quit.

135
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,140
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.

136
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,330
How you holding up?

137
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,960
She doesn't know?

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,850
About John being in prison? Oliver told me.

139
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm so sorry.

140
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,770
What Lyla means--

141
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,300
we are gonna break him out.

142
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,930
Of military prison?

143
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,450
- Yep. - Wait, and then what?

144
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,250
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?

145
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,190
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,070
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.

147
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.

151
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,950
You don't have what now?

152
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,430
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John

153
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,300
than coming home to his own wife and child.

154
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,090
Ok. So wait a minute.

155
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,170
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies

156
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,310
and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life,

157
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,600
he doesn't actually want you to?

158
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,950
Can I speak with you for a minute?

159
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,660
Yeah.

160
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,780
Is she going to be a problem?

161
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,820
No, but...

162
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,450
I was counting on her being a help.

163
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,360
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.

164
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,130
No. If this--if this has your fingerprints on it,

165
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,700
then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.

166
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,720
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.

167
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,510
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech,

168
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,790
An antimolecular compound.

169
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,130
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.

170
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,750
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.

171
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,540
Second test over.

172
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,800
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.

173
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,060
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,

174
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,990
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.

175
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,160
Pass third and final test, find out.

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,230
What's the test?

177
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,130
You keep asking about Kovar.

178
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,940
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.

179
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,390
You have to act fast, though.

180
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,280
He will be arraigned in morning.

181
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,380
Arraigned?

182
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,980
- Jail. - Yeah

183
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,150
But what makes you think he'll talk to me.

184
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,160
You trust me. I trust you.

185
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,400
Look. It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?

186
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,700
It's not for drinking.

187
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,390
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?

190
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,070
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.

191
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,670
Don't worry. Thea told us.

192
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,870
I'm sorry, man. Gout is a bitch.

193
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,060
Yes, it is.

194
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,810
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.

195
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,510
Well, fortunately, we now have

196
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,270
a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.

197
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,600
It'll be great working with you.

198
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,530
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?

199
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,020
Yeah. I mean, a lot of people out there

200
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,840
probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion.

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,580
But thank you.

202
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,290
Public service isn't easy.

203
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,640
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.

204
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,760
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night

205
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,000
that may help in our case against Tobias Church.

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,820
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member

207
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,460
Turned Church strongman.

208
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,900
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes

209
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,990
left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.

210
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,860
The only thing that was missing was a bow.

211
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,840
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.

212
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,010
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.

213
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,830
If we need their help to get our streets clean--

214
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,460
It means we haven't done our jobs right.

215
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,220
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?

216
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,270
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.

217
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,210
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.

218
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,050
Not a chance.

219
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.

220
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,920
Good. Uh, if it's all right with you,

221
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,990
I'll have Quentin accompany you,

222
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,670
be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.

223
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,420
Sure.

224
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,680
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.

225
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,780
Great.

226
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm sorry. When did, uh, babysitting evidence

227
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,500
become part of the job description?

228
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,840
Since I trust you.

229
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,510
You do?

230
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,800
I mean, all things considered?

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
If we didn't think you were right for the job,

232
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,510
we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?

233
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,680
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?

234
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,580
Where the hell are you going anyway?

235
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,950
Strange time for a vacation.

236
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,350
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.

237
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,620
Should I even ask?

238
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,530
No. I--I'm not gonna be gone long.

239
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,360
Just please make sure

240
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,150
that no one destroys the city while I'm away.

241
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,950
Sure.

242
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,350
OK.

243
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,360
What are you doing?

244
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,220
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log

245
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,380
on what we kept from getting stolen

246
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,250
from Kord Industries last night.

247
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,880
- 6,800 processor. - So?

248
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,970
Exactly. Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech,

249
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,080
military-grade weapons,

250
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,980
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.

251
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,060
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip

252
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,210
That you could buy from any tech village store?

253
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,240
Well, who cares? Everything's on its way to lockup now.

254
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,390
Because knowing what Church's endgame was

255
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,840
is like--it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.

256
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,880
You all right over there?

257
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,550
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't,

258
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,030
which is very weird.

259
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,680
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?

260
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,510
Yeah.

261
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,750
Oh! He's not sick with the flu, is he?

262
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,680
No. He's just sick of working with me.

263
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,990
Did you try talking to him?

264
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,170
There's not a lot I can say

265
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,400
that would make him feel OK about his entire family being killed.

266
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,150
Incoming.

267
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,510
Another robbery in progress at--

268
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,570
Palmer Tech! I got to call Oliver.

271
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,840
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let them get robbed.

272
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,650
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.

273
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,320
He fired me. You quit.

274
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
Because he fired you. Same thing.

275
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,200
Sanchez, you got anything?

276
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,020
Nada.

277
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,370
What's up?

278
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,810
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.

279
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,790
Are you still in the area?

280
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,440
Yeah. I can look into that.

281
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,910
How was Palmer Tech?

282
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,680
Before you answer,

283
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,990
you should consider that your phone has GPS,

284
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,610
and if you were thinking about lying,

285
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,650
I do admire your consistency.

286
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,330
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.

287
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,660
I wasn't looping you in

288
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,560
after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.

289
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,020
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.

290
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,450
John's not thinking clearly.

291
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,400
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,

292
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,220
I think he would tell you

293
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,380
that life on the run is no life at all,

294
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,860
and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.

295
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,370
Roy was making a bad choice

296
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,500
just like John is making a bad choice.

297
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,260
He is currently locked up in a military prison

298
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,070
for a crime he didn't commit.

299
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,940
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?

300
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,840
John doesn't want to leave.

301
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
It is not your choice.

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,830
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?

303
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,810
He already abandoned the team.

304
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,970
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.

305
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,230
Is that what this is about,

306
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,360
John leaving the team?

307
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,410
This is simple.

308
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,280
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.

309
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,520
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.

310
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,000
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory

311
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,130
is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?

312
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,290
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again,

313
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,690
handling evidence?

314
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,790
No. Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either,

315
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,750
But here we are.

316
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,640
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.

317
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,710
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh--

318
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,870
a complicated history.

319
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,320
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.

320
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,810
Yeah. Well, at least I know where they're buried.

321
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,930
That's something you can't buy or steal.

322
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,740
Package is here, boss.

323
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,760
D.A., deputy mayor, too.

324
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,850
Bonus.

325
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,760
Get ready to move.

326
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,530
Let me guess. Felicity filled you in.

327
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,820
That you're gonna break into a military prison?

328
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,240
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?

329
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,210
I'm done debating this.

330
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,760
Really? Because this is the first we've heard of it.

331
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,150
I thought we were your team.

332
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,630
Running off to bust someone out of prison

333
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,090
sounds like team business,

334
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,320
And what happens to us when you get caught?

335
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,440
You've made it clear that

336
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,310
we can't do this vigilante thing without you.

337
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,550
When I get caught? I'm not gonna get caught.

338
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,230
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.

339
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,250
I'm sorry.

340
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,280
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?

341
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,290
Yes. I need to see you physically deposit the item.

342
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,770
I've been on this job 15 years.

343
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,080
I've never lost a piece of evidence.

344
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,380
Now relax, sergeant.

345
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,580
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?

346
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,130
Seems like.

347
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,890
This is it.

348
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,470
You gonna let me do my job now?

349
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,470
Have at it.

351
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,800
What the hell?

352
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,090
Get out of here!

353
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,210
Find the weapons, boys.

354
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,570
Sorry, gents.

355
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,260
Load them up!

356
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,790
And burn this puppy down.

357
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,960
Let's go, let's go!

358
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,610
OK.

359
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,690
Last chance.

360
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,260
Get off the street.

361
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,420
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.

362
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,130
You know what really sucks?

363
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,760
Realizing that in all those training sessions

364
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,150
where he was kicking our respective asses

365
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,400
the whole time he was taking it easy on us.

366
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,130
Yeah. Remind me to never, ever

367
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,520
get on his bad side.

368
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,780
I think that would imply that he has a good side,

369
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,920
And, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again

370
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,610
how you thought this was all gonna go down?

371
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,690
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united

372
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,360
against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.

373
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,580
Right because Oliver Queen is known

374
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,140
for thinking things through and taking input from others.

375
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,940
Right.

376
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,180
The ever-expanding club house.

377
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,120
And who are you?

378
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.

379
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,090
And also his sister.

380
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,820
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too,

381
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,150
Ollie did this?

382
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,250
Object lesson, long story.

383
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,530
It's fine. Don't ask.

384
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,560
What happened to you?

385
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,460
Tobias Church happened.

386
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,960
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries--

387
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,700
Modified to go boom.

388
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,760
He wanted it to be put into lockup.

389
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,840
And he wanted to raid it.

390
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,380
One-stop shopping for weapons.

391
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,960
Including those RPGs that he took from AmerTek

392
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,910
If this report's right.

395
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,150
We got to find out what he's planning

396
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,420
to do with those weapons--because it ain't nothing good.

397
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,090
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.

398
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,730
Yeah. I just tried him. He's gone dark.

399
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,510
Why don't you guys hit the streets?

400
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,070
We want to figure out what Church is up to

401
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,210
before it's too late.

402
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,350
You sure?

403
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,220
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.

404
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,040
Right. Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.

405
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,580
OK, but this is an all hands on deck situation,

406
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,140
rag-covered hands included.

407
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,610
Just saying.

409
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,200
Where's Private Jesseman?

410
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,390
This is usually his delivery.

411
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,130
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.

412
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,340
I drew the short straw.

413
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,550
I don't see you on the list.

414
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,380
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.

415
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,590
You sure he didn't?

416
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,050
It's an hour's drive back to the base.

417
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,570
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?

418
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,460
There you are.

419
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,710
As you were, private.

420
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,660
Thank you, sir.

422
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,190
I'm in.

423
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,030
25 minutes till extraction.

424
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,970
Roger that.

425
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,870
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.

426
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,420
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.

427
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,170
- I'm on my way. - Oliver...

428
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,810
If you don't make it to the extraction point--

429
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,960
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.

432
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,590
You speak English?

433
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,140
Yes.

434
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,960
Your accent... you are American.

435
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,410
Yeah, maybe once upon a time,

436
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,990
But, uh, now I'm more just enjoying

437
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,730
everything that Russia has to offer.

438
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,830
Yes. I can smell that.

439
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,340
You judge me?

440
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,880
You're in this cell, too.

441
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,750
Yes. A mistake my boss will correct very soon.

442
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,800
You mean Konstantin Kovar?

443
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,330
How do you know that name?

444
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,070
Same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin,

445
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,270
Same way I know that you launder money for Kovar,

446
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,720
Same way that I know

447
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,010
that's what you're doing here.

448
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,170
How can you know that unless...

449
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,530
Are you Bratva?

452
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,780
He's fine.

453
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,290
I am Bratva,

454
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,310
and you are gonna tell me everything

455
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,870
that I want to know.

456
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,900
Your turn to run system check.

457
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,930
I'm gonna hit the head.

458
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't touch my ball.

459
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,200
Dude, what the hell?

460
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,830
Transponder's in place.

461
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,350
Roger that. I've got eyes now.

462
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,820
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.

463
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,600
Hey. Is this... uh, is this a bad time?

464
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,430
Do I want to even ask how you found me?

465
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,700
Heh. I feel like that's a trick question.

466
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,130
Sorry about the mess.

467
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,440
These are amazing.

468
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,920
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs,

469
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,180
you find ways to make something useful out of them.

470
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,960
My father always used to say that.

471
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,530
He owned a pawn shop.

472
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,120
On Southmoor Road, right?

473
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,480
How'd you know?

474
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,240
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team

475
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
to honor your father.

476
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
When you quit...

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,270
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.

479
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
Your father was a Gulf War veteran,

480
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,940
2nd battalion, 1st marines,

481
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,610
but that's not what made him a hero, was it?

482
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,180
No.

483
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,280
He wore your rags,

484
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,660
like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.

485
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,440
That's a big legacy to live up to.

486
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,560
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.

487
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,470
I'm gonna have to live with that

488
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,180
every day for the rest of my life,

489
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,790
Knowing that I cannot fix it

490
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,500
and knowing that it's not the last mistake

491
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,280
that I'm ever going to have to make.

492
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,450
I still don't know if I can--

493
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,750
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder

494
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,950
of what you lost.

495
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,290
I understand.

496
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,110
Just like you're a reminder of what I did,

497
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,920
and I-I know they're not the same thing.

498
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,190
We both want the same thing,

499
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,690
to be able to live with what's happened

500
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,740
so that we can move forward.

502
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,800
It's Curtis.

503
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,630
I am so sorry,

504
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,160
and we could really use you.

505
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,640
I can't right now.

506
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,820
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,050
If you change your mind, well, we're here.

508
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,330
Cell 1138,

509
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,400
right side, third from the left.

510
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,570
He's not here.

511
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,510
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.

512
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
Oh, no.

513
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,470
What?

514
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,120
They moved him into gen pop.

515
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,500
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.

516
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,230
Talk to me. When's he coming back to his cell?

518
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,410
Outside our window.

519
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,850
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do

520
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,400
is move John and all the other prisoners

521
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,740
to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.

523
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,900
Abort. We're blown.

524
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,260
Tell me where I can find Kovar.

525
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,000
You think you scare me more than him?

526
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,010
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.

527
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,170
I am.

528
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,250
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.

529
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,530
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.

530
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,260
Same can't be said for Alisa.

531
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,250
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya

532
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,790
when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.

533
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,920
Somebody is gonna die.

534
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,020
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child,

535
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,480
but I need you to choose

536
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,060
and do it quickly.

537
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,380
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.

538
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,450
We never meet in person,

539
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,680
Only remotely.

540
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,020
Remotely? How?

541
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,110
A digital dead drop, the dark web.

542
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,510
What's the IP address?

543
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,370
What is the IP address?

544
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,850
108.166.7.161.
108.166.7.161.

545
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,300
If this information is incorrect,

546
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,850
Your family will suffer.

547
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,610
How does an American become this...this...

548
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,000
Bratva devil?

549
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,500
I don't know.

555
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,390
About time, blondie. Can we go now?

556
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,830
First of all, not my name.

557
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,800
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?

558
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,730
No, but street cams actually picked him up,

559
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,620
So we know he's on the move.

560
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,920
We just don't know where he's moving to.

562
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,170
We can't go after Church without knowing

563
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,380
his endgame first.

564
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,500
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.

565
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,050
Not nothing.

566
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,740
You're cross-plotting Church's prior locations

567
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,900
into a projection algorithm.

568
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,600
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.

569
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,870
And junior high.

570
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,800
Ok. Based on Church's route, I'm calculating

572
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,720
an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 mill road.

573
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,730
Why does that sound so familiar?

574
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,110
Because we were just there

575
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,580
to hand over sergio.

576
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,760
That's where the ACU's bunkered.

577
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,580
Church is gonna take them out.

578
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,440
Montes, quit screwing around.

579
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,000
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block C.

580
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,690
Ave a code yellow situation.

581
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,530
Initiate immediate lockdown

582
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,970
and have all prisoners return to their cells.

583
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,120
I'm not rolling on Church.

584
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,020
You think you scare me more than him?

585
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,540
No...

586
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,700
But he's not here with you.

587
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,460
I am.

588
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,220
You're not gonna put a beating on me.

589
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,510
You're a D.A.

590
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,360
Yeah. Haven't you heard?

591
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,470
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.

592
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,600
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something,

593
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,190
something big.

594
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,790
You tell me what it is,

595
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,460
and he'll be the one in those cuffs

596
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,800
instead of you.

597
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,040
You're talking about the trust.

598
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Oh, you can't stop it, man.

599
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,300
Can't even come close.

600
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,780
What the hell is going on?

601
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,780
Church.

602
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,890
At least we definitely know where Church is now.

603
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,100
D'Angelo's right.

604
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,160
We got to put him down.

605
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,810
Against that? Without Oliver?

606
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,150
No. We're sh-- shorthanded as it is.

607
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,990
You scared?

608
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,070
No, but I'm not stupid either.

609
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,190
Evie's right.

610
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,470
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.

611
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,490
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

612
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,250
You saw what you're up against, ok?

613
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,940
This isn't some drill where you take down

614
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,420
a petty thug or drug dealer.

615
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,360
This is real, ok, with real stakes.

616
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,880
The three of you could die out there.

617
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,960
That's something we get to decide for ourselves,

618
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,520
isn't it?

619
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,520
I mean, I don't know about everyone else,

620
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,810
but I didn't join this team to stay safe.

621
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,510
Ok. Why don't we take a vote?

622
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,310
All those in favor...

623
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,020
We're all gonna say yes, blondie.

624
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,640
God. That's not my name.

625
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,690
Good. Ok. Go. Do not die.

626
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,960
Code yellow.

627
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,910
Return all prisoners to their cells.

628
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,890
Code yellow.

629
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,760
Return all prisoners to their cells.

630
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,000
Hey, John. What's new?

631
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,640
I'm not doing this. I told Lyla.

632
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,890
Yeah. You can yell at us later,

633
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,360
but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.

634
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,650
Are you even hearing me right now?

635
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,030
I don't want anything to do with this.

636
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,400
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.

637
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,450
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.

638
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,720
Really? So that's your play, blackmail?

639
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,760
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?

640
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,030
You're my brother, John.

641
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,670
What happens to you happens to me.

642
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,850
Oliver...

643
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,900
I killed my brother.

644
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,300
I went to the army to change,

645
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,700
and I haven't changed.

646
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,190
I know, all right,

647
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,750
and I know that you think this is your penance for that.

648
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,780
Oliver, it's not just that.

649
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,070
I trusted Andy.

650
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,880
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him,

651
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,080
and now Laurel's dead.

652
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,430
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.

653
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,310
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.

654
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,690
You probably should,

655
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,720
but do it as Spartan.

656
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,090
What's in the box?

657
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,210
It's an antimolecular compound,

658
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,300
and theoretically, it should eat through anything.

659
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,330
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.

660
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,770
Hey. You came back for me,

661
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,070
even against my wishes.

662
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,240
I guess I haven't changed that much either.

663
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,010
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.

664
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,480
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.

665
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,060
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for ARGUS.

666
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,590
Should have known she'd be helping out.

667
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,190
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.

668
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,360
You've got to keep moving.

669
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,750
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.

670
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,670
What--what is it?

671
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,670
Comm's being jammed.

672
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,880
No, no, no.

673
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,410
Hey. Is there another way out of here?

674
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,860
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?

675
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,660
Hey. If that's for taking out the wall,

676
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,190
the blast will kill us before we can get out.

677
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,240
We're in too tight.

678
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,210
- Trust me. ?- Yeah, says the creepy-looking--?

679
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,130
What the hell are you anyways?

680
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,670
I'm in place. Blow it.

681
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,660
Sorry we blew up your building.

682
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,820
Come on!

683
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,070
We're going up.

684
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,340
Then what?

685
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,140
Which way, overwatch?

686
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,400
Take a right ?at the end of that hallway.?

687
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,490
It should be a fire exit.

688
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,970
If you go through there, you're home free easy.

689
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,050
Not so easy.

690
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,310
Rags, cover me.

691
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,820
Go! Go, go!

692
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,710
Go!

693
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,760
Go!

694
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,600
Get him up.

695
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,260
Come on.

696
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,880
I probably should just shoot you,

697
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,030
But...

698
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,210
But you've earned a little suffering.

699
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,390
Get him to safety.

700
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,910
- But-- - Go!

701
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,930
Hey. Don't kill him.

702
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,660
He may have his uses.

703
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,470
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.

704
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,840
Copy. Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.

705
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,910
We could use some help.

706
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,470
Inbound. Hold on.

707
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,340
Get in!

708
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,000
Where's the Wild Dog kid?

709
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,620
Still inside, fighting Church.

710
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,920
We've got to go back for him.

711
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,910
No. Unless you all want to die,

712
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,190
We've got to go now, now!

713
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,470
We can't just leave him.

714
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,210
You have to. Go.

715
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,420
Come on!

716
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,910
- Here. - What's this?

717
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,160
Just put it on.

718
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,930
Let's go.

719
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,140
Dig, your harness.

720
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,390
You two, freeze!

721
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,280
Down on the ground! Lace your fingers behind your head!

722
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,120
Do it now, or we will shoot!

723
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,240
John, don't move.

724
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,120
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being,

725
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,850
until we find a permanent solution.

726
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,320
Hey. First things first.

727
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,680
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.

728
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,430
For better or worse, Johnny.

729
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,000
Told you I wanted to stay.

730
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,260
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions

731
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,640
then you wouldn¡¯t have gotten married.

732
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,540
Ok. How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?

733
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,460
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?

734
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,950
I know Felicity.

735
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
What's wrong?

736
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,000
I have to go.

737
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
When you said you haven't changed...

738
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,810
Don't.

739
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,200
Dobroye utro.

740
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,650
How was first night in Russian prison?

741
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,800
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.

742
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,210
Mission accomplished.

743
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,070
You're being sarcasm, yes?

744
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,080
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.

745
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,830
He didn't deserve to die.

746
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,570
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.

747
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,030
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.

748
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,500
If he is warning Kovar,

749
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,490
his information not so good.

750
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,720
Vy ponimayete?

751
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,290
Maybe you could have explained that to me

752
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,020
before you sent me in there.

753
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,430
I almost didn't kill him.

754
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,820
But you did. Why?

755
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,590
Because you told me to.

756
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,980
You trust us.

757
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,030
Now we trust you.

758
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,870
Third test over.

759
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,460
You get it?

760
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,670
You are Bratva now, family.

761
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Last handful of honest cops in this city,

762
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,050
and Church nearly took them out along with me.

763
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,690
We're just glad you're all right.

764
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,690
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare.

765
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,470
Something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.

766
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,590
Look. He called in this morning.

767
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,360
His health problems are almost over.

768
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,910
That's good news.

769
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,070
Um, we're--we're hearing that

770
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,190
one of the, uh, Vigilantes who was part of the rescue,

771
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,060
that he didn't make it out.

772
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,510
Um, any word on him?

773
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,940
CSU hasn't found a body, so...

774
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,680
So Church has him.

775
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,720
I spent most of my life thinking that

776
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,670
men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.

777
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,030
I may have to reevaluate that.

778
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,800
Let me know when Queen gets in.

779
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
Will do.

780
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,240
Are you all right?

781
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

782
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,350
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.

783
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,040
But that doesn't make it sting any less.

784
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,520
Well, yeah, sure it does.

785
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,700
The year I've had, this is--this is easy.

786
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,270
Yeah. I mean, cold as that sounds.

787
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,790
Look. I know why you're asking, ok,

788
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,130
and I'm--I'm fine.

789
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,520
Ok.

790
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,700
I mean, I'm--I'm--I'm just saying

791
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,770
if things ever get less easy,

792
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,370
you know I'm here for you, right?

793
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,490
Noted...

794
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,990
and appreciated.

795
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,680
Ok.

796
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,020
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery

797
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,690
if you can't use it to find anybody?

798
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,920
I feel like I don't understand

799
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,780
half the sentences you say.

800
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,990
What I'm saying is that no matter how hard I try

801
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,110
I cannot find Rene anywhere.

802
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,810
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.

803
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,830
Sounds like another impossible decision.

804
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,730
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?

805
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,370
I'm saying you were right.

806
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,060
If we're gonna do this,

807
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,160
we can't let guilt swallow us up.

808
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,530
I'll keep you from doing it

809
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,230
if you promise the same for me.

810
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,920
Deal.

811
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,360
So "ow" then?

812
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,320
Things have really fallen apart

813
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,220
without Oliver, haven't they?

814
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,840
It's a good thing I'm back then.

815
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,270
Was he waiting for an entrance line?

816
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,420
Nope. He's just that cool.

817
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,680
I got your text. Have we found Rene?

818
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,680
You get John?

819
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,320
Yeah. He's fine. He's holed up at HIVE.

820
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,410
I couldn't write him off,

821
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,270
and we are not gonna write off Rene.

822
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,380
We're gonna find him,

823
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,820
We're gonna bring him back...

824
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,920
wherever he is.

825
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,280
Ah. Wakey, wakey.

826
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,080
Man, it's been a long time

827
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,060
since I've been tagged like this.

828
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,440
Respect.

829
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,750
Oh, my pleasure,

830
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,380
but I promise you if you untie me

831
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,600
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.

832
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,780
Ooh, man, you got spirit.

833
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,280
And I'm duly impressed.

834
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,600
And I'm gonna break this spirit.

835
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,340
I'm going to break your soul.

836
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,040
And when we're finished,

837
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,550
assuming you're still alive.

838
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,400
Now, I wouldn't bet no money on that, though.

839
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,180
This gonna be very little of you left for

840
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,310
the Green Arrow to work with.

841
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,800
Light him up.
